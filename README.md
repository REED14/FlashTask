Just a web app that will handle the tasks for you or will help you get hired to do the tasks for somebody else.

Flash Task is a platform where you can hire people to do the chores around the house for you just with a click of a button (or more clicks). It was developed in such a way that everyone who wants to get their tasks done could do it easily and securely, the worker being tracked while working. On the other side, everyone who would want to work could do that simply, just by opening an account and browsing through tasks.

The backend was written in PHP.

The technologies used were:
 - Stripe(for receiving payments and commissions)
 - Google API(for worker tracking and location)
 - Nominatim(for geolocation)
 - MySql
 - jQuery(Ajax)
